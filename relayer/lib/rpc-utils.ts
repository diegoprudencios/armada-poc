 * silent-error swallow, a single dead provider could freeze the entire CCTP scanner. Loud
 * timeout > silent hang.

 *
 * The `label` argument flows into the error message — pass something descriptive
 * (`'getLogs hub blocks 100-600'`) so logs are actionable when timeouts surface.
 *
 * NOTE: this does not cancel the underlying promise (no AbortSignal here — most ethers v6
 * provider calls don't accept one). The provider keeps working; we just stop waiting. The
 * lingering work eventually errors or completes and is discarded. Acceptable cost for the
