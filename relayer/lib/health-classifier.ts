/**
 * Threshold multipliers expressed relative to the chain's configured pollIntervalMs.
 *
 * Why relative to pollInterval rather than absolute ms? Different chains run different poll
 * cadences (mainnet vs L2 testnet, mock-anvil vs real-Sepolia). A fixed 30s "stale" threshold
 * would either be too sensitive on a 60s poller or too forgiving on a 5s poller. Tying the
 * thresholds to N×interval keeps the classifier well-tuned regardless of operator config.
 *
 * Tuning rationale:
 *  - `stale` at 3× allows one missed tick + buffer for the next tick to start — anything
 *    longer than that and the scanner is genuinely stuck (not just slow).
 *  - `unhealthy` at 10× corresponds to ~5 minutes at a 30s poll cadence, the same ballpark
 *    operators expect for "page someone now." Bump if you find this too noisy.
 *
 * `LAG_BLOCKS_DEGRADED` is absolute (not relative) because block production is roughly fixed
 * on each chain — 100 blocks behind on Sepolia (~20 min) is the same operational concern
 * regardless of how often we're polling. Set conservatively; the scanner's chunked getLogs
 * means it WILL catch up, but until it does, anything depending on cursor freshness is lagging.
